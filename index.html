			<p id="overview">This website includes examples of my work in Ms. Changs Web Development I Class</p>

			<h2>Unit 2</h2>
			<p><img src="http://dailydropcap.com/images/I-10-cap.png" title="Daily Drop Cap by Jessica Hische" align="left" alt="I"/>n this unit I learned about coding videos in a web page and adding captions and a poster image. I also learned about creating data tables and coding the rows and columns for it. Plus I learned about linking pages to external websites and linking pages within my website. I also learned about the different types of video formats and how some of those formats dont work on certain web browsers Finially I learned how to create unordered and ordered lists.</p> <br>

			<ul>
				<li>Coding tables with a specific number of rows and columns</li>
				<li>Adding a poster image to a video</li>
				<li>Linking specific links while creating a shortcut link</li>
			</ul>
			
			<h2>Unit 3</h2>
			<p class= "temp">This unit taught me how to format web pages with CSS. I learned about color theory and how to add your own colors on your web page. Also I learned how to code in typography and how some certain fonts dont necessarily get to be coed on a web page. The hardest part about this unit was learning how to code in box models. You have to figure out th perfect units of measurement for the padding, border and margin. But we also learned about roles of ID and classes. Finally we learned about page layout techniques and how every item is spaced on the web page. </p>
				
			<h2>Unit 4</h2>
			<p class= "temp">In this unit, I learned about resizing images and changing its resolution to fit a size requirement and how to user a scanner to incorperate photos into a website. I also learned about different types of exporting images with its right jpg/png/gif. I think that creating a button and favicon was difficult because the resolution and sizes were very small making it difficult for me to visualize what it would look like on the website. Finally I learned how to make a webpage banner and use various types of tools to seperate an object from its background.</p>
					
			<h2>Unit 5</h2>
			<p class= "temp">In this unit i learned how functions are essential to HTML. in order for something to happen of for an action to take place, there must be a command. Not only does there need to be a command, but also a receiver of that command. This comes in handy especially when you want to add elements such as buttons. You need to tell the button what to do and when to do it. If the coomands and functions don't work right away, then you need to make sure that the communication between command and receiver are working smoothly.</p>
						
			<h2>Unit 6</h2>
			<p class= "temp">I learned about validating websites and how effective there are when it comes to check your coding. When it comes to spelling errors, ending attributes forgetten, etc. Testing usability is also important when you want your website to improve. By having others take a survey about my website, I learned what needs to be changed and what I can make better. I also learned how to add radio buttons and a drop down menu on my website.</p>
							
			<h2>Unit 7</h2>
